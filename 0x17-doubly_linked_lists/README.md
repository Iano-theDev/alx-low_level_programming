# Data Structures, Doubly Dinked Lists

* Doubly linked lists have an extra pointer to the previous node
* This is both a good and a bad thing.

### Advantages
    ** Traversal can be done both ways
    ** Easy insertion and deletion while given a node
    ** Easy access of the previous node compared to SLL

### Disadvantages
    ** Need extra space to store the extra pointer
    ** Operations may become expenceive since they require that the previous pointer be maintained

* There's a way to have a doubly linked list whith only a single pointer using the XOR operator.
