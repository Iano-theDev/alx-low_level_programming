# VARIADIC FUNCTIONS AND CONST KEY WORD

* when you use const key word before the return type of a pointer
  ** the pointer can not change the value it dereferences,
  ** that said, one can change the address the pointer points to

  ** To avoid this behavior, one can place the const key word before the
  ** asterisk and the pointer name
